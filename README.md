## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

I did expand challenge a little bit to make it more "real". I implemented fake network function that is a promise with timer randomly delayed by up to 2000ms.

With those changes Users should also be able:

- See skeleton UI while fetching data from the server
